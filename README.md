Search Input: Users are greeted with a minimalist search interface where they can type any term.

Retrieval: Upon initiating a search, the application processes the query using a comprehensive dictionary database to retrieve a concise definition.

Display: Definitions are immediately displayed in a readable format, allowing for quick comprehension and learning.


# Usage Scenario

Imagine a student in a library working on a research paper, encountering unfamiliar terms. Instead of flipping through pages of a dictionary, they use Quick Definition to instantly obtain clear explanations, streamlining their study process and enhancing their understanding.

# Clean Architecture 

Clean architecture is a strategic framework used to develop software in a way that enhances its maintainability, scalability, and independence from UI, database, or any external agency. In the context of Quick Definition, implementing clean architecture means organizing the code into separate layers, each with a distinct responsibility. This separation ensures that the app is not only easier to manage but also more adaptable to changes in technology or business requirements.

Domain Layer: This is the core of the app, where the business logic resides. It defines entities, use cases, and interfaces that represent the various functionalities of the application.

Data Layer: Contains data access and data source implementations. The app's interactions with the Gemini API and other data management operations are defined here, ensuring that the domain layer remains independent of data source changes.

Presentation Layer: Focuses on the UI, using Flutter and Dart. It interacts with the domain layer to handle user input and display data. This layer is kept separate from business logic, which means UI changes do not affect the core functionalities.
